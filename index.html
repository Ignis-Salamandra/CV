        <p>Now this is the story all about how</p> <!-- <p> and </p> is for paragraph -->
        <p>My life got flipped, turned upside down</p>
        <p>And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there</p>
        <p>I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised</p>
        <p>On the playground where I spent most of my days</p>
        <p>Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool</p>
        <p>And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school</p>
        <p>When a couple of guys, they were up to no good</p>
        <p>Started making trouble in my neighbourhood</p>
        <p>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared</p>
        <p>And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air"</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the</p>
        <p>License plate said "fresh" and had a dice in the mirror</p>
        <p>If anything I could say that this cab was rare</p>
        <p>But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight</p>
        <p>And I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!"</p>
        <p>Looked at my kingdom I was finally there</p>
        <p>To sit on my throne as the <em>Prince of Bel-air</em></p>
        </p>
